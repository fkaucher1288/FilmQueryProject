# FilmQueryProject
Film Query Project involved creating an app that allowed a user to select between 3 options, 2 of which would return the user a list of from a database movies and details about the movies based on either a key word or a movie id number. The third option would exit the app.
# WhatILearned
This project was my first exposure to a lot of things. This is the first time I used maven, the first time I used sql outside of practice, and it was the first time I incorporated sql in my java code. The details of getting the database to communicate with java were definitely challenging. I had issues with the initial set up as a typo made my git try to connect to the wrong repository and that took troubleshooting to figure out and fix. I also had issues with getting languages and actors to populate in my search results due to not properly populating my arraylist with objects of actors. Once I got those issues ironed out most of the rest of the project was pretty intuitive.
